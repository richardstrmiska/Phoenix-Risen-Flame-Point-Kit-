## 🧭 The FlamePoint Principle

**Your FlamePoint is wherever your soul says it is.**

- It may be a mountain, a street, a childhood home.
- It may be a trauma site you’re transmuting.
- It may be a dream location or an inner plane.
- It may be a place only your soul remembers.

🕯️ **You name it. You claim it. You light it.**
